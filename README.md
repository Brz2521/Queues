# Queues
In this program, it included a modification of an Employee class python file and a Dirany
text file was used. This is a class structured program, where the employee data is saved in
the dirany.txt file. The program reads the dirany.txt file and creates an Employee object
for each employee in the file, then adds the employees to a queue data structure in the
order of the file.
